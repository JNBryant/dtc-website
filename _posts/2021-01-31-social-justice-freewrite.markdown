I view social justice as equality on all levels regardless of a person’s social status, that being any defining characteristic of them or their character. This means that one can expect to be treated fairly in any situation and not discriminated against based on factors within or without their control. To me, this is very important because personally, many of my defining characteristics, including but not limited to my race, deviate from what might be considered the “social norm” by many and as a result, might possibly lead to myself being treated differently than others. Social injustice is unfortunately a very real thing in today's world.

Similarly to what I stated in the last paragraph, racial justice to me is equality for all regardless of their race. Almost no grown person in this world is a stranger to racism. It's very present in the lives of all, whether you see it in the news or on social media, personally witness it, or even fall victim to it. It's unfair for anyone to live a different life based on their racial identity, whether that be due to the inability to secure a good-paying job or (discriminatory housing practices)[https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/fair_housing_act_overview] that should have never required the passage of a law in an attempt to avert.
